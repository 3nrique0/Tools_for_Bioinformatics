# Tools_for_Bioinformatics
This are my custom made tools made mostly in python and bash to use them in my bioinformatics problems I encountered.
If there's a problem making them work or there any comments, please let me know.

DATA
The sample data is kept in the Data directory. It is organised in Input and Output, the inputs will thusly available for all tools. These sample data files will be as small as possible to help run the tests as fast as possible.
